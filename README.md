# Up-Heal-DAO-New-Logo-Design

Greetings. 

In this work, I create the logo design ofÂ **Up Heal DAO**. Here, I would thank for the opportunity to do this work. It's a pleasure create again. 

#### Product Requirement :dart:
---

I should fit the design of the brand I created. I also have to avoid the use of colors that are so bright that they are hard on the eyes. The logo must also **look good in black and white**, grayscale, and two colors. The trick here for me is to get inspired by the **creativity and have fun**!

#### Mental health and finance symbology :symbols:
---

Having recognized the purposes of **Up Heal DAO**, I've decide to start researching in the web. Symbology is a very important reference in logo design, and should be taken as a basis of imagination. So I made research, absorbed content and draw sketches.

#### Digital handoff :computer:
---

**Dicisions are always important**, and they have to be done with precision. Then, we can have **success**. 
After brainstorm sessions, create and re-create things, I found a result. It's attached in this page, somewhere (maybe on issues). Let's watch...


Thank you.
